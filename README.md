I am using UV as virtual envirnoment

My client `llm` will call Math Server to get addition and multiplcation then it will pass the value from math Server to weather server to get the weather details.

TODOS:

- Instead of returning multiplcation - return zip code. Pass that zipcode to weather server to get the weather result.
- Please create a .env file and add 
GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR KEY"

Commands to Run
```uv init`` if you dont have pyproject.toml or if you are doing from scratch.

Open Terminal 1 to run weather

```uv venv```
```source .venv/bin/activate```
```uv add -r requirements.txt```
```python weather.py```

Open Terminal 2 to run client that aggregates addition and weather

```uv venv```
```source .venv/bin/activate```
```uv add -r requirements.txt```
```python client.py```

Output

```Math Answer: The result of (3 + 5) * 12 is calculated as follows:

1. **Add 3 and 5**:  
   \( 3 + 5 = 8 \)

2. **Multiply the result by 12**:  
   \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \)

**Final Answer:**  
\boxed{96}
Extracted number : 96
Weather Answer: The weather in location 96 is **rainy all the time**. However, the temperature information you mentioned ({math_result}) isn't available through the provided tools. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!
